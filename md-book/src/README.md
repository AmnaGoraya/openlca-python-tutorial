# Introduction

[openLCA](https://github.com/GreenDelta/olca-app) is a Java application
and, thus, runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). [Jython](http://www.jython.org/)
is a Python 2.7 implementation that runs on the JVM. It compiles Python code to
Java bytecode which is then executed on the JVM. The final release of Jython 2.7
is bundled with openLCA.
